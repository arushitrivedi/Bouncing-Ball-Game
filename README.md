# Bouncing-Ball-Game
So here's a gift 🎁 of childhood for all the lovely people out there who want to dive in nostalgia like me! 🤩
<br>
<br>
This is a clone of a video game 🎮 that was played by the 90's and early 2000.  
# Rules to play
The rules are simple.
<br> <br>
♦️ Shoot the ball with the paddle and try to hit all the bricks.
<br> <br>
♦️ So, able to hit all the bricks? Bingo! You are a champion! 🏆
<br> <br>
♦️ Remember the ball should not fall off the paddle, else the "GAME OVER" alert will pop-up! ⚠️
<br><br>
♦️ Still no worries, you can click on the "OK" button to refesh and replay! 🥳

# About
The game is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses HTML canvas and Javascript to draw the ball, paddle and bricks.
Everytime a brick is hit, the score is updated. If all the bricks are hit, a vitory message pops up! If the ball drops, a game-over message pops up! The game can be played using the arrow key controls on the keyboard or a mouse can also be used.

You can fork the project or download the files in your PC and run the "index.html" file in your web browser. That's all! You are good to go!!!
<br>
Enjoy your gaming spree...!! 😄😄
